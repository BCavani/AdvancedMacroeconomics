# AdvancedMacroeconomics

Here you can find the routines mentioned in "Advanced Macroeconomics" notes at https://brunocavani.org/bruno-cavani/lecture-notes/.

In general, these are codes written by Guilherme Gallego and myself during a project of studying the implementation of incomplete-markets models in the fashion of Bewley-Huggett-Aiyagari, while the lecture notes of Marcelo Santos, Tiago Cavalcanti and Jesús Fernández-Villaverde were of great support.
